                            <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5" id="Introduction">Introduction</h2>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">The flatiron building, formerly called as fuller building, is a triangular steel-framed multi-storey building and is among the tallest structures in New York City and has become the most beloved symbol and icon of the city. With its distinctive wedge shape, the Flatiron Building is one of the most famous historic landmarks and was one of the Tallest structures of the city at the time it was built..</p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">The building has become so famous that in almost every movie or show , planned to be set in Manhatten, a shot of this 22-storey building is de rigueur.
                                The entire neighborhood around it is called the flatiron district which is named after this iconic building.
                                </p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Lets explore how this signature building was made possible and what challenges were faced in its creation !!!</p>

                            <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5" id="History and Creation">History and Creation</h2>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">It was originally called the Fuller Building - named after George A. Fuller, CEO of Fuller Company and is considered by many to be ‘the father of skyscraper’ - and was intended to serve as offices for the Company.</p>
                            <div id="fullerdiv">
                                <img src="images/fuller.png"/>
                                <figcaption>Fig. George A. Fuller</figcaption>
                            </div>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Due to its resemblance with household items like an old-fashioned cast-iron clothes iron, the building derived its name ‘Flatiron’. It was constructed between 1901 and 1903 at the intersection of Broadway and Fifth Avenue, one of the most prominent locations in the city at the time.</p>
                            <div id="fullerdiv"><img src="images/phases.png"/></div>

                            <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5" id="Design">Design</h2>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Not only was the Flatiron Building one of New York’s first skyscrapers, but it was also the first steel-skeleton structure whose construction was visible to the public.</p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Its unique design was made possible by a sturdy steel skeleton — a newer construction technique at the time — allowing for thin, graceful walls and a quicker build using pre-cut frames.</p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Around the steel skeleton is a limestone base, which changes to terra-cotta as the floors go up. While its shape was the building’s point of attraction, its Renaissance-inspired Beaux-Arts facade was worthy of attention too, it features columns, medallions, balustrades, friezes, and gargoyles perched along the 22nd floor.</p>
                            <div id="fullerdiv"><img src="images/facade.png"/></div><br/>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4"> The pointed end of the building is only 6.5 feet wide and opens up to an acute angle of roughly 25 degrees.</p>
                            <div id="fullerdiv"><img src="images/1903.png"/></div>

                            <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5" id="Post-Completion">Post-Completion</h2>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">When the construction began, the building received mixed responses from the people, with many residents believing that the triangle shape combined with the height would cause the building to eventually fall down, thus giving it the nickname "Burnham's Folly"  while, at the same time garnered praises for the cleverness of Engineering involved.</p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Despite all these, The Flatiron Building was designated a New York City landmark in 1966, was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1979, and was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1989.</p>

                            <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5" id="Influence">Influence</h2>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">The building remains one of the most popular tourist attractions in the city and one of the most photographed buildings in the world.</p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">The Flatiron has featured in countless postcard images and renderings. It is frequently used in television commercials and documentaries as an easily recognizable symbol of the city. For instance, in the opening credits of ‘The Late Show with David Letterman’ or in some transition scenes of various sitcoms like ‘friends’ etc. It has also been featured in films like ‘Bell, Book and Candle’, ‘Spider-Man’, ‘Reds’, and ‘Godzilla’ in which it is shown being destroyed by the US Army.</p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">As well as being an instantly recognizable icon of New York, the Flatiron Building is credited with popularizing the term “23 Skidoo”. Ever hear the old expression “23 Skidoo”? It means “get lost,” and The story behind its origin is hilarious and naughty at the same time.
